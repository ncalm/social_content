# Content created for the data community

Welcome! 

This repository contains the content I've created and shared with the data community on LinkedIn.

These files are intended to be bite-sized introductions or elaborations on specific topics that occur to me from time to time.

My aim is to share knowledge in a clear but detailed way in a format that is easily consumed.

If you like this kind of thing, you can follow me here, on LinkedIn, on YouTube or visit my blog.
